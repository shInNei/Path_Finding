*Visualize shortest paths with the powerful A* algorithm!*

## 📖 About

This project implements the **A* (A-Star)** pathfinding algorithm, a popular heuristic-based approach for finding the shortest path between two points. The tool includes an interactive visualization to help users understand how the algorithm explores nodes and evaluates paths.

### ✨ Features
- Interactive grid-based visualization.
- Supports diagonal and straight-line movement.
- Adjustable heuristic (e.g., Manhattan, Euclidean).
- Step-by-step demonstration of pathfinding.
- User-friendly GUI.

## 🖥️ Demo

### Example Scenarios:
- **Obstacle Navigation**:
  > Finds the optimal route around obstacles.
- **Dynamic Adjustments**:
  > Add or remove barriers dynamically and re-run the algorithm.

## 📚 Algorithm Overview

The **A*** algorithm combines:
1. **Cost from Start (g):** Distance from the start node to the current node.
2. **Heuristic (h):** Estimated distance from the current node to the target node.

### Formula:
