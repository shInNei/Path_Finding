# ðŸš€ Pathfinding Visualization and Implementation
This project demonstrates the implementation and visualization of various pathfinding algorithms. Starting as a small project for the Introduction to AI course at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology (HCMUT), it has now expanded to include multiple algorithms as an extension of the original project.
The visualizations leverage Pygame, inspired by [this excellent tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A&t=199s)
### âœ… Implemented Algorithms:
- [x] **A***: Shortest pathfinding with heuristic optimization.
### ðŸš§ In Progress:
- [ ] **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Shortest path for weighted graphs (non-negative weights).
- [ ] **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Guaranteed shortest path for unweighted graphs.
- [ ] **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Not guaranteed to find the shortest path.
- [ ] **Bellman-Ford Algorithm**: Handles graphs with negative weights.
- [ ] **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: All-pairs shortest paths.
## ðŸ“– About
This project was initially created as part of a coursework assignment for the Introduction to AI course at HCMUT. The original focus was implementing the A* algorithm for pathfinding, along with a basic visualization using Pygame. Inspired by the engaging visual explanation in [Tech with Tim's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtiK0DOeI4A&t=199s), I decided to take the project further by adding support for more algorithms and improving the overall functionality.
## ðŸŽ¯ Goals of the Project
The main goals of this project are:
- To implement and visualize a variety of pathfinding algorithms.
- To provide a clear understanding of how each algorithm works, using visual representation.
